# version control system

what/why?
- track changes to code/doc
- avoid manual version control-copying and remaning egv1.1,v1.2
- easy to see previous version /work & rollback changes
- who /when /what was changed. 
- compare changes


# Early version control
- often tracked changes to individual files.
- there was a base file , each version tracked using a delta.

# centralised VCS distributed VCS like git

# 3 state of commit
- working directory-modified
- staging area-added to index
- git directory-committed

## Git command 
- git init - initalise the repository
- git add - add the changes
- git status - check the status
- git commit - commit the changes
